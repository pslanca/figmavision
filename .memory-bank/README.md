# Memory Bank System

This directory contains the **Memory Bank System** - a template for maintaining context across AI assistant sessions.

## How It Works

Each `.md` file captures specific aspects of the project:

- **`brief.md`** - Project overview and current status
- **`product.md`** - User goals and success metrics
- **`context.md`** - Latest session work and key learnings
- **`architecture.md`** - System design and components
- **`tech.md`** - Technology stack and reference

## For AI Assistants

When starting a new session, read these files in order:
1. `brief.md` → `product.md` → `context.md` → `architecture.md` → `tech.md`

This provides complete project context without needing repetitive explanations.

## For Users

Update these files after significant work sessions to maintain continuity. The system enables:

- **Instant context** for new AI sessions
- **Project knowledge preservation**
- **Reduced setup time**
- **Consistent understanding** across interactions

## Template System

These files serve as templates. Users can:
- Copy and customize for their own projects
- Adapt the memory bank structure to their needs
- Add project-specific context files

This demonstrates how to give AI assistants long-term memory and project continuity.
