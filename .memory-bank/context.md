# Current Work Context

## Latest Session Summary
**September 24, 2025** - Completed perfect Medium hero grid configuration:

### Major Achievements
1. **Perfect Auto-Layout Implementation**:
   - Main container: 1140×600px with FIXED sizing
   - 60px padding and spacing throughout
   - CENTER alignment on both axes
   - Inner grids: layoutGrow=1 + layoutAlign='STRETCH'

2. **Code Quality**:
   - Rebuilt from scratch to demonstrate understanding
   - Clean, commented, professional implementation
   - Proper HSL color generation and hue sorting
   - 64 color squares (60×60px each) in responsive 8×8 grids

3. **Project Cleanup**:
   - Removed 10+ unnecessary files and directories
   - Eliminated multiple plugin variants
   - Streamlined to single working implementation
   - Clean git history with meaningful commits

### Key Technical Insights Learned
- `layoutGrow = 1` makes children fill available space
- `layoutAlign = 'STRETCH'` stretches to container height
- `primaryAxisSizingMode = 'FIXED'` prevents auto-layout conflicts
- Container math: 1140px - 120px padding - 60px gap = 960px → ~480px per grid

### Current State
- **Code**: Production-ready Medium hero generator
- **Git**: Clean, pushed to main branch
- **Structure**: Organized and minimal
- **Ready for**: Immediate use in next session
