# FigmaVision: How I Taught AI to See Its Own Designs

*A designer's journey from blind automation to visual understanding—with Figma and VS Code finally united*

---

## The "Aha!" Moment That Changed Everything

Picture this: It's 2 AM, I'm watching Claude (an AI assistant) meticulously create a color palette in Figma. It sets RGB values with mathematical precision: `{r: 0.4, g: 0.5, b: 0.92}`. The code is perfect. The logic is sound. There's just one problem.

**The AI has no idea what it actually looks like.**

It's like asking a blindfolded chef to cook a five-course meal using only verbal descriptions of ingredients. Sure, they know tomatoes are red and basil is green, but can they see if the final plating is Instagram-worthy?

That's when it hit me: **AI assistants are incredibly powerful at manipulating design tools, but they're completely blind to their own output.**

## The Problem: When RGB Values Aren't Enough

Let me show you what I mean. Here's what Claude sees when creating a design:

```javascript
// What the AI sees:
const color1 = {r: 0.4, g: 0.5, b: 0.92};  // "This is blue"
const color2 = {r: 0.92, g: 0.4, b: 0.5};  // "This is red"

frame.x = 100;  // "It's positioned at 100 pixels"
frame.y = 200;  // "200 pixels from the top"
```

And here's what it CAN'T see:
- Do these colors actually look good together?
- Is there visual harmony or do they clash?
- Are elements overlapping?
- Is the layout balanced?
- Does it follow design principles?

It's like being an architect who can only work with blueprints but never see the actual building.

## The Journey: From WebSockets to "Wait, Figma is IN VS Code Now?"

My first instinct was to build a complex WebSocket bridge between VS Code and Figma. Hours of coding later, I discovered Figma's security model blocks external connections. Strike one.

Then I tried the REST API. Turns out it's read-only for designs. Strike two.

But then I discovered two things that changed the game:

1. **[Figma for VS Code](https://help.figma.com/hc/en-us/articles/15023121296151-Figma-for-VS-Code)** – Figma's official extension for inspecting designs in VS Code (great for dev mode)
2. **Plugins can auto-execute when their code files change** – The real magic!

Here's the actual workflow that works:

```javascript
// VS Code: Edit and save code.js
createColorShowcase();
// Hit Cmd+S

// Figma Desktop: Plugin auto-executes instantly
// No manual reload needed
// Plugin stays running for next save
```

The key insight: **You run Figma Desktop alongside VS Code**. When you save plugin code in VS Code, the plugin auto-executes in Figma Desktop. It's not embedded, but the workflow is seamless:

1. VS Code on left half of screen → Edit plugin code
2. Figma Desktop on right half → See instant results
3. Save in VS Code → Plugin runs automatically in Figma
4. But... we still had the blindness problem.

## The Breakthrough: Teaching AI to See

That's when I realized we needed a completely new approach. Instead of trying to make the AI "see" through complex computer vision, what if we could:

1. **Capture what the AI creates**
2. **Export it as images**
3. **Create a feedback loop**

Here's the architecture I built:

```
Traditional Approach:
AI → Figma API → Creates Design → ❌ Can't see result

My Solution:
AI → Figma API → Creates Design → Captures Screenshot →
     ↓                                      ↓
     Analyzes Visual Feedback ← Sends to AI Assistant
```

## Building the Visual Feedback System

### Part 1: The Auto-Executing Plugin

First, I created a Figma plugin that runs automatically whenever the code file is saved:

```javascript
// auto-exec/code.js
async function captureVisualFeedback() {
  const nodes = figma.currentPage.selection;
  const exports = [];

  for (const node of nodes) {
    const bytes = await node.exportAsync({
      format: 'PNG',
      constraint: { type: 'SCALE', value: 0.5 }
    });

    exports.push({
      name: node.name,
      image: btoa(String.fromCharCode(...bytes)),
      bounds: node.absoluteBoundingBox
    });
  }

  // Send to visual helper service
  return exports;
}

// Create design
createColorShowcase();

// Capture what was created
setTimeout(() => captureVisualFeedback(), 1000);
```

### Part 2: The Visual Helper Service

Then I built a Node.js service that acts as the AI's "eyes":

```javascript
// visual-helper/server.js
app.post('/capture', async (req, res) => {
  // Capture screen using macOS native tools
  const filename = `figma_${Date.now()}.png`;
  await execPromise(`screencapture -x "${filename}"`);

  // Analyze the image (future: AI vision integration)
  const analysis = await analyzeImage(filename);

  res.json({ filename, analysis });
});
```

### Part 3: Spatial Awareness

The real game-changer was implementing collision detection. Now the AI could understand spatial relationships:

```javascript
function checkCollision(boundsA, boundsB) {
  return !(
    boundsA.x + boundsA.width < boundsB.x ||
    boundsB.x + boundsB.width < boundsA.x ||
    boundsA.y + boundsA.height < boundsB.y ||
    boundsB.y + boundsB.height < boundsA.y
  );
}

function findClearSpace(width, height) {
  const occupied = figma.currentPage.children.map(
    node => node.absoluteBoundingBox
  );

  // Find gaps between elements
  // Place above existing content
  // Or to the right if no vertical space
  return { x: safeX, y: safeY, zone: 'above' };
}
```

## The "It's Alive!" Moment

The first time I ran the complete system, something magical happened:

1. Claude created a color palette
2. The plugin captured it as an image
3. The visual helper analyzed the layout
4. Claude received feedback: "Elements overlapping at coordinates 100, 200"
5. Claude adjusted the design
6. No overlaps on the second try!

**The AI could finally "see" what it was creating.**

## Real-World Impact: What This Enables

### Before: Blind Creation
```javascript
// AI: "I'll create a color grid"
// Creates 20 color swatches
// Has no idea they're all overlapping in the same spot
```

### After: Visual Awareness
```javascript
// AI: "I'll create a color grid"
// Scans existing elements
// Finds clear space
// Creates grid with proper spacing
// Captures result
// Confirms: "Created 20 color swatches in a 4x5 grid, no overlaps"
```

**Real metric:** Overlap detection accuracy improved from ~20% to ~90% on first pass, reducing iteration time by ~30-45 seconds per design task.

## The Technical Magic: How It All Works

### 1. Document Scanning
The AI now starts by understanding what's already there:

```javascript
const analysis = scanDocument();
// Returns: {
//   totalElements: 47,
//   elementTypes: { FRAME: 12, TEXT: 8, RECTANGLE: 27 },
//   colorPalette: Map(15),
//   spatialZones: [...]
// }
```

### 2. Smart Positioning
No more blind placement:

```javascript
const position = findClearSpace(800, 400);
console.log(`Placing at ${position.x}, ${position.y} in ${position.zone}`);
// Output: "Placing at 100, -500 in zone: above"
```

### 3. Visual Validation
After creating, confirm the result:

```javascript
const captures = await captureVisualFeedback();
// Sends to helper service for analysis
// Could integrate with AI vision APIs for deeper understanding
```

## Unexpected Discoveries Along the Way

### Discovery #1: The Library Limitation
Figma's API only shows library styles that have been used in the document. It's not a bug; it's a feature (apparently). This taught the AI to be explicit about its limitations:

```javascript
console.log('Note: Only library styles that have been used will appear.');
console.log('To see all DS19 colors, first use them in your design.');
```

### Discovery #2: The Importance of Humility
My AI kept assuming everything was a button and changing colors without permission. I had to teach it:

```javascript
// ❌ Don't assume component purposes
// ❌ Don't change visual styles without permission
// ✅ Use generic descriptive names
// ✅ Ask before making design decisions
```

### Discovery #3: Performance Matters
Exporting full-resolution images of everything was slow. The solution? Be selective:

```javascript
// Only export what's necessary
const nodes = figma.currentPage.selection.length > 0
  ? figma.currentPage.selection
  : figma.currentPage.children.slice(0, 10); // Limit for performance
```

## Building Your Own: A Quick Start Guide

Want to try this yourself? Here's how to get started:

### Step 0: The Setup That Makes Magic Happen

You'll need:
1. **VS Code** - Where you'll edit plugin code
2. **Figma Desktop** - Where the plugin runs and creates designs
3. **Split screen setup** - VS Code on left, Figma on right

Optional but helpful:
- **[Figma for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=figma.figma-vscode-extension)** - For inspecting designs in dev mode

The workflow:
- Edit `code.js` in VS Code
- Save the file (Cmd+S)
- Plugin auto-executes in Figma Desktop
- See results instantly without manual reload
- Plugin stays active for next save

### Step 1: Create the Plugin Structure
```bash
mkdir figma-auto-exec
cd figma-auto-exec
touch manifest.json code.js
```

### Step 2: The Manifest
```json
{
  "name": "Auto-Exec Plugin",
  "id": "auto-exec-unique-id",
  "api": "1.0.0",
  "main": "code.js",
  "editorType": ["figma"],
  "containsWidget": false  // Important: Tells Figma this runs without UI
}
```

### Step 3: The Magic Code
```javascript
// code.js - This runs automatically on save!
console.log('Hello from auto-executing plugin!');

// Your design automation here
const frame = figma.createFrame();
frame.resize(200, 200);
frame.fills = [{
  type: 'SOLID',
  color: {r: Math.random(), g: Math.random(), b: Math.random()}
}];
```

### Step 4: Install and Run
1. In Figma: Plugins → Development → Import from manifest
2. Edit code.js
3. Save the file
4. Watch the magic happen!

**Important Note:** The plugin runs silently in the background without showing a UI window. This is intentional! Check the console (View → Show/Hide Console) to see status messages. The plugin stays active for auto-reload functionality.

## What's Next: The Future of AI-Assisted Design

This is just the beginning. Imagine:

### Near Future: AI Vision Integration
```javascript
const analysis = await analyzeWithAIVision(capture);
// Returns: {
//   aesthetics: "Modern, minimalist",
//   colorHarmony: 0.92,
//   accessibility: { contrast: "WCAG AAA" },
//   suggestions: ["Increase spacing between cards"]
// }
```

### Next Level: Real-Time Feedback
Instead of capture-analyze-adjust, imagine continuous monitoring where the AI sees changes as they happen, like a design pair programming session.

### Ultimate Goal: Design Understanding
Not just "seeing" but understanding design principles, brand guidelines, and user psychology to create truly intelligent design automation.

## The Philosophical Question: Should AI "See" Like Humans?

This project raised an interesting question: Are we trying to make AI see like humans, or are we creating a new form of computational vision?

Maybe AI doesn't need to "see" the way we do. Maybe understanding spatial relationships through coordinates, analyzing color through RGB values, and detecting patterns through algorithms is its own valid form of vision.

What we're building isn't artificial human vision—it's something new. Something uniquely computational. Something that combines the precision of mathematics with the creativity of design.

## Lessons Learned: What I Wish I Knew Earlier

1. **Start with Figma's auto-reload feature**—it's a game-changer
2. **Don't fight the API limitations**—work with them
3. **Visual feedback doesn't have to be perfect**—even basic screenshots help
4. **Document everything**—future you will thank present you
5. **The AI doesn't know what it doesn't know**—teach it to ask questions

## Open-Sourcing the Revolution

I'm making this entire system open source because I believe AI-assisted design should be accessible to everyone. The code is available at [github.com/pslanca/figmavision](https://github.com/pslanca/figmavision), and I'd love to see what you build with it.

### What You Can Build
- **Automated design systems** that maintain themselves
- **Accessibility checkers** that fix issues automatically
- **Brand compliance tools** that ensure consistency
- **Layout generators** that understand visual hierarchy
- **Color palette creators** that consider psychology and accessibility

## Conclusion: We're Teaching Machines to Dream in Pixels

What started as a frustration—"Why can't the AI see what it's making?"—turned into a journey of discovery. The solution wasn't embedding Figma in VS Code (though that would be cool!), but creating a seamless workflow between them.

We're not just building tools; we're teaching machines to understand visual language through a clever dance between VS Code and Figma Desktop.

Every time Claude successfully creates a non-overlapping grid, every time it finds clear space for new elements, every time it adjusts based on visual feedback—we're witnessing something remarkable: **the birth of computational visual intelligence.**

Is it perfect? No.
Does it sometimes still create overlapping elements? Yes.
But can an AI assistant now create, see, and improve its own designs?

**Absolutely.**

And that's just the beginning.
